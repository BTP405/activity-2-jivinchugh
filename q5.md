1. 
in the first approach, we are giving n=5, here range value is 0 to n-1 which would be 4, so the list would be 0:1:2:3:4 but when append happens, it is multiplied by 2 which gets the output to be 0:2:4:6:8

in second approach, the values are doubled in this inner loop [n*2 for n in range(5)] whereas the outerloop just prints the value generated in this loop which would be 0:2:4:6:8

in third approach, yield here acts as a return function and results in returning a i*2 value for the range and prints it one by one in the second for loop which is 'for i in doubleG(5)'

2. doubleG(n) is a generator function and it uses yield instead of return, it helps in reducing the memory consumption by yielding the values only when they're needed, no value being held in the memory at any given time leaves memory free and since the values are generated only on demand, this makes the program execution time lesser.
